# Note to Teachers

It's wonderful that you are considering using these materials — or some subset of them — in your introductory cybersecurity course!

### Reading Philosophy

The readings selected for this course are designed to be interesting, dynamic, and, whenever possible, narrative-driven. While the majority of readings are technical, their purpose is to simply provide students with the domain knowledge necessary to put their 'security mindsets' to good use. In other words, the technical readings play a supporting role to the narrative ones.

### Preparing to Teach

In addition to working through all the materials listed in the units, you may also find the following items beneficial to your own understanding:

* _Dark Territory_ by Fred Kaplan
* _Swiped_ by Adam Levin
* _Spam Nation_ by Brian Krebs
* ...

* prepare with real-world

### Shelf Life

Cybersecurity, like computer technology generally, is an evolving field. While the security mindset lessons included in these materials will likely prove relevant far into the future, the technical materials will probably be obsolete after 8 to 10 years — if not sooner. If the year is 2030 and you're using these materials as they were written in 2019 — well, you probably shouldn't.

### Active Reading and Discussion Questions

After every reading, a number of discussion questions are listed. On days when other technical lectures or discussions are not planned, you may consider leading an open-ended conversation using the prior lesson's readings as a starting point.

### Unit 0

Unit 0 is entirely non-technical; its material, while a hugely important element of the course, does not involve any coding. This potentially leaves room for you to teach the basics of Python, for example, concurrently.

### Further Reading

If you would like to do additional reading before teaching this course, I recommend the following books. Note that their content doesn't uniformly relate to the course material itself; instead, they are meant to give you a better understanding of the world of cybersecurity. To brush up on your "hard skills," I recommend working through all of the readings in each subunit.
