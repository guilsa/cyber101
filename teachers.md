# Note to Teachers

It's wonderful that you are considering using these materials — or some subset of them — in your introductory cybersecurity course!

### Reading Philosophy

The readings selected for this course are designed to be interesting, dynamic, and, whenever possible, narrative-driven. While the majority of readings are technical, their purpose is to simply provide students with the domain knowledge necessary to put their 'security mindsets' to good use. In other words, the technical readings play a supporting role to the narrative ones.

### Preparing to Teach

In addition to working through all the materials listed in the units, you may also find the following items beneficial to your own understanding:

* _Dark Territory_ by Fred Kaplan
* _Swiped_ by Adam Levin
* _Spam Nation_ by Brian Krebs
* ...

### Shelf Life

Cybersecurity, like computer technology generally, is an evolving field. While the security mindset lessons included in these materials will likely prove relevant far into the future, the technical materials will probably be obsolete after 8 to 10 years — if not sooner. If the year is 2030 and you're using these materials as they were written in 2019 — well, you probably shouldn't.
