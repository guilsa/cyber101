# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity involves thinking about digital systems not in terms of how they might be _used_, but instead in terms of how they might be _misused_. Just as a computer scientist must have a firm grasp of data structures and algorithms to keep her programs fast, she must also have a similar understanding of cybersecurity to keep her programs secure.<sup>0</sup>

Put formally, the objective of these course materials is to provide the domain knowledge necessary to perform effective threat modeling and extensive attack vector identification. Put more colloquially, the purpose is to teach you how to think not only about _users and capabilities_ but _abusers and vulnerabilities_. Fortunately, these are two sides of the same coin; the negative space left by the other.

In your computer science education thus far, you've likely spent most of your time thinking about the "light side" of systems: that which is intended. Welcome to the dark side.

?> You may find it odd that the word "cybersecurity" doesn't appear in the objective of a course about cybersecurity. That's because cybersecurity isn't a field of computer science in the same sense as, for example, database engineering. Database engineering is a field in and of itself; cybersecurity, by contrast, is thinking about systems not only in terms of how they can be _used_, but also how they can be _misused_. For more information, see [Cybersecurity & Hacking](/core/cybersecurity).

### How To Use These Materials

These course materials are meant to be worked through in the order they are listed in the navigation menu. While you _can_ jump around throughout the topics and still find the enclosed materials helpful, each unit, reading, and project builds on those that came before it. In most cases, you'll be best served by gradually working through these materials from start to finish â€” or, in terms of the navigation menu, from top to bottom.

Note that this is _not_ a textbook. A textbook is self-contained; these materials are not. Each unit links heavily to readings created by experts in their respected fields. A fundamental idea in cryptography is to never "roll your own crypto," which is to say that you shouldn't implement complex encryption systems yourself. (Unless your name is on [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptographers), in which case, well, why are you here?) Instead, you should use a peer-reviewed implementation written by expert(s).

### Prerequisites

This course assumes the following technical skills:

* Fluency in Python 3

Perhaps more notable is what the course _does not_ assume knowledge of:

* Cryptography
* The nuances of operating systems
* Network protocols
* Web development
* Social engineering
