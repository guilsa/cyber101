# Malware

Malware. You probably already know what it is. In fact, maybe you know _all too well_ what it is. Malware is generally synonymous with "virus," and is among the most frustrating &mdash; and dangerous &mdash; elements of the digital world.

In the readings that follow, you'll learn about the various different kinds of malware that are in circulation today. As you read (and listen), think about how these viruses circumvent the operating system security mechanisms you learned about in the previous readings.

?> **Not all malware exists in the operating system.** Some online cryptocurrency miners work in the browser, and don't circumvent any operating system security mechanisms at all! Nonetheless, a not-insignificant portion of malware works as "deep" in the computer as what most could consider the operating system level (or deeper, in the case of rootkits).

This introduction by the SANS Institute provides a useful introduction to various types of malware. This is by far the densest reading in this section, and much of this information won't be repeated in later readings. So read carefully! _Remember that you only need to read to page 26 in this document!_

?> **This reading is a bit old.** Published in 2008, it's beginning to show its age. Nonetheless, nearly all of its information is still applicable today. Just keep in mind that many of the techniques mentioned have evolved.
