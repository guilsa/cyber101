!> **Be careful!** When working with malware, it's important that you don't accidentally infect &mdash; or damage &mdash; your own computer. Never _run_ malware outside of a virtual machine, for example.

You receive a frantic call from your father. "Alice, I think I might have infected my computer with malware!" he says to you. Your task is to work with your father to control the situation and minimize the impact of the malware on his computer. Note the following:

* Your father's computer has lots of sensitive information on it, such as bank info and tax returns.
* Your father keeps monthly backups, and the last backup was three weeks ago.
* Your father doesn't know _how_ he got the virus, but he's been saying that there's an odd new toolbar in his browser. Moreover, the CPU and network usage will spike to 100% at random, sometimes for hours at a time.
* You have physical access to the computer (hint: you can remove its hard drive).

Given this information, work with your father to help minimize the impact of the malware. This exercise does not involve any coding.

1. What is the first thing you do?
2. What kind of malware does this resemble?
3. Assuming that you cannot be confident that you have _entirely_ eradicated the malware from your father's computer, you instead salvage all the important documents from his hard drive and then wipe the computer entirely. Assuming that you use the same (now wiped) hard disk, is this approach guaranteed to remove the malware? Why or why not?
4. What next steps do you give your father to secure his life (both online and offline)?
