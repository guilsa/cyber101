We use operating systems every day. In fact, you're probably using one as you read this text! If you're taking this class, you probably also have an idea of _which_ operating system you're using. On your laptop or desktop computer, it's likely either Mac OS X (stylized `macOS`), Windows, or some variant of Linux. On your phone, it's almost certainly iOS or Android.

You probably also have an intuitive sense of what the purpose of an operating system is. It manages your screen's brightness, it's the program that manages all the other programs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) defines an operating system as follows:

> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. (Wikipedia, "operating systems")

Understanding how operating systems work is foundational to effective cybersecurity. After all, if your operating system is hacked — well, so is everything else on the computer. Because nearly all systems run on an operating system of some form or another, nearly all digital systems are also reliant on the security of those operating systems. Most malware, for example, operates by taking over the host operating system in some way or another.

In short: in order to secure a system, you must understand its environment. In the digital world, that environment more often than not includes the operating system.

?> **Networking is not covered in this unit.** Although interfacing with the network is among the key tasks of operating systems, it will not be covered in this unit — instead, it will be explored in more detail in Unit 3.

### Unit Questions

By the end of this unit, you should be able to confidently answer the following questions:

* What is an operating system? What does it do?
* What are users? What are tasks (processes)? What are permissions?
* What is Mac OS X? What is Linux? What is Windows? How do they differ on a technical level?
* What is a filesystem? What is a path? What are the different types of file systems?
* How can a filesystem be encrypted?
