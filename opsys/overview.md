This "intro to operating systems" guide will introduce to nearly everything you need to know about operating systems. It dives a bit deeper into technical details than the Crash Course video, so read it closely. The concepts it covers will resurface frequently.

You don't need to understand every single word in this article, but you should understand each _general idea_. If you find yourself zoning out or not understanding for more than three sentences, take a step back and try to understand again. You may even need to consult Wikipedia a few times!

#### Key Questions

* What is a process?
* What is 'memory'? What is the stack? What is the heap? (And how is 'storage' separate?)
* What is a thread? How does it differ from a process?
* What is the kernel? What does it do?
* What is shared memory? How do threads communicate?
* What is virtualization?
* What is a server? How does it differ from a 'normal' computer? What is 'the cloud'?

This guide produced by Linux Info provides an introduction to the _kernel_. Though it is Linux-specific, its concepts translate to both Mac OS X and Windows.

#### Key Questions

* What does the kernel do? Does the end-user ever interact with it?
* What would be the 'opposite' of a kernel on a typical computer?
* What is a monolithic kernel? What is a microkernel?
