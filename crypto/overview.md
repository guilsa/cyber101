# Overview

What even _is_ cryptography? As usual, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) provides a useful introduction:

> Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. (Wikipedia, "Cryptography")

In essence, cryptography uses math to ensure _confidentiality_, _integrity_, and _authentication_. That's right: cryptography is about much more than just keeping secrets.

The following readings are meant to provide you with an overview of cryptography. While they might be low on technical details, rest assured that these holes will be filled in the subsequent sections. Unless you're writing or implementing cryptographic algorithms yourself, you'll be better served by understanding the big picture of cryptography than knowing each little detail.

This Electronic Frontier Foundation guide explores threat modeling as it relates to individuals. It is useful not only for understanding the questions you need to ask as part of a threat model, but also as a guide to secure your own online — and offline — life.

#### Key Questions

* What is threat modeling?
* How can threat modeling be applied to your own life?

This conference talk at LayerOne 2017 by security expert Dan Tentler explores threat modeling in the context of cybersecurity. To save time, you may consider watching this talk at 1.5x speed (with captions enabled). It provides highly useful, relevant, and distilled information, however, so do pay attention.

#### Key Questions

* What are the key steps in threat modeling?
* What are some of the common vulnerabilities that Dan explored in his talk? Can you describe how they work with some degree of confidence?
* What does it mean to be "pragmatic" when it comes to security? Is this necessarily a bad thing? Where does pragmatism intersect with threat modeling? (Hint: threat modeling _is_ a form of pragmatism, in a sense!)

This longform-style article by Ryan Gallagher explores his own process of threat modeling (and is strongly inspired by the previous two materials). In addition to summarizing common vulnerabilities and threat actors, the article also provides a substantial survey of common ideas and terms in cybersecurity that you'll want to be sure you understand.

#### Key Questions

* How does the author's threat model differ from your own?
* How is the author's threat model similar to your own?
* What are some common threat actors?
* What is risk assessment? How does risk assessment relate to cybersecurity?
