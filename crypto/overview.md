# Overview

What even _is_ cryptography? As usual, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) provides a useful introduction:

> Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. (Wikipedia, "Cryptography")

In essence, cryptography uses math to ensure _confidentiality_, _integrity_, and _authentication_. That's right: cryptography is about much more than just keeping secrets.

The following readings are meant to provide you with an overview of cryptography. While they might be low on technical details, rest assured that these holes will be filled in the subsequent sections. Unless you're writing or implementing cryptographic algorithms yourself, you'll be better served by understanding the big picture of cryptography than knowing each little detail.

This brief documentation for z/OS produced by IBM provides a succinct overview of the most important concepts in cryptography. Be sure you understand these concepts, as they are fundamental.

#### Key Questions

* What does _enciphering_ mean? What is ciphertext? Is this different from _encryption_?
* What is _deciphering_? Why is there no such thing as _deciphertext_?
* What is hashing? How is it different from encryption? [what is one-way really mean?]
* What is a digital signature? How is it useful?

This 1993 WIRED article describes the rise of the Cypherpunks and the world of cryptography they envisioned. This article — among Wired's oldest — demonstrates how cryptography is more than just a collection of algorithms and codes. For some, it is a worldview.

#### Key Questions

* Who were the Cipherpunks?
* What is the promise of cryptography to those in the article?
* How does the article affect your understanding of the Internet today?
* Based on your current understanding of the Internet, what do you think those described in the article would think of today's digital landscape?
