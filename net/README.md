While malicious computer users likely date as far back as computers themselves, the rise of networked systems &mdash; such as automated telephone prompts and the Internet &mdash; allowed for the rise of widespread computer exploitation. Once a system was connected to other systems, attack surfaces tended to increase exponentially; that is, each additional computer connected to a network meant yet another attack surface for every other computer on that network. And networks tend to expand exponentially.

In this unit, we will explore the rise of networked systems, how they work, and the never-ending battle for network security.
