# Phishing

Have you ever received a suspicious email asking you to log in to your account to confirm your details? Have you ever received an email from a frantic IT administrator telling you _not_ to click that link? If so, then someone has tried to phish you. Phishing is a form of _social engineering_ in which someone tries to send you an email with links typically to a fake login page that is secretly controlled by the attacker.

In this subunit, you'll learn about one of the most common means of compromising someone's digital life. While you probably are familiar with phishing already, this rabbit hole is deeper than you think.
