# Legal Context

Cybercrime carries a harsh legal penalty â€” and sometimes, what constitutes cybercrime is not entirely clear. Before learning more about cybersecurity, you should make sure you understand how to stay on the right side of the law, and what can happen when you don't.

!> **Don't ever do anything that could be considered hacking if you aren't in a tightly controlled environment.** Unless you can be absolutely sure that your actions could not be interpreted as cybercrime, refrain from doing anything remotely related to security hacking or penetration testing. Acceptable security hacking includes analyzing and exploiting programs distributed explicitly as exercises on your own computer. Unacceptable security hacking, on the other hand, would be probing your own school's website for vulnerabilities without clear permission from top administrators. For your own sake, be careful.
