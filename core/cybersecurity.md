# Cybersecurity and Hacking

What is cybersecurity? What is hacking? What does it mean to "think like a hacker" — whilst remaining within the boundaries of the law?

These are essential questions that any student of computer security must know the answer to. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), cybersecurity (also referred to as _computer security_) is defined as:

> The protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. (Wikipedia, "Computer Security")

Hacking, on the other hand, has an entirely different meaning. In the context of computer security, "hacking" is often used to mean _cybercrime_. Rest assured, this is not the only definition of hacking. In tech-literate circles, you'll often find that hacking refers to using systems in new and novel ways. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) puts the definition of "hacker" well:

> A computer hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem. While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker", someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems. (Wikipedia, "Hacker")

!> Don't say _hacker_ when you mean _cybercriminal_. Lots of people — especially those who work on computer security — identify either as "hackers" or with hacker culture, even though they are not cybercriminals. _Hacker_ can mean lots of things. _Cybercriminal_ is much more clear.

This New York Times opinion piece by a computer security professor explores why learning cybersecurity requires students to think like criminals — even if they aren't breaking the law themselves.

#### Key Questions

* What is the "hacking mindset"? Do you have it? How might you further develop yours?
* What is the difference between the "hacking mindset" and simply _thinking outside the box_?
* How might one learn cybersecurity in a classroom setting? How might one teach it?

Bruce Schneier, a world-renowned computer security expert, discusses the way computer security experts need to view systems in order to be effective.

### Key Questions

* What does the "hacking mindset" look like in the real world?
* Where is the "hacking mindset" often absent?
* What does "cybersecurity" mean to non-technical companies (i.e. organizations where 'tech' plays a _supporting_, not _primary_, role)? How might this affect that organization's threat model and attack surface? How are threat modeling and employees' "hacking mindset" (or lack thereof) connected?

This _New Yorker_ article follows students at UC Berkeley as they take part in a class on cyberwar and try to discover vulnerabilities in public software. As "ethical hackers," the students don't exploit the vulnerabilities they find — instead, they report them to the services themselves so that they can be fixed.

#### Key Questions

* What does it mean to be an "ethical hacker"?
* What tools are available to "ethical hackers"?
* What is your perception of "hacker culture"? Do you identify with it at all?
