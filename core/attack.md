# Attack Vectors & Attack Surfaces

A common idea in the world of cybersecurity is that of an 'attack surface.' [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) defines the concept of an attack surface quite well:

> The attack surface of a software environment is the sum of the different points (the "attack vectors") where an unauthorized user (the "attacker") can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment. Keeping the attack surface as small as possible is a basic security measure. (Wikipedia, "Attack Surface")

An attack vector against a home might be an unsecured lock. An attack vector against a website might be an admin account with an insecure password. Against a large corporation, an attack vector might be employee's email accounts — after all, a cybercriminal could likely fool at least one employee into revealing their login credentials using a phishing email. Taken together, attack vectors constitute an attack surface.

?> **This is important!** You'll need to fully understand the concept of attack vectors to understand the materials that will follow later in the course.

The following readings are a collection of stories and technical documents that will give you a sense of what attack vectors and attack surfaces are in the real world.

This Wired article provides a useful primer on the concept of an attack surface. Using the CIA Vault 7 leaks as an example, the story explores various analogies for attack surfaces in a clear, non-technical style.

#### Key Questions

* How can virtual intrusions cause real scares?
* What does the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime look like?

Read through the most recent twenty entries to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Because each CVE represents a vulnerability and, by extension, a potential attack vector, think about the potential implicates of each one. (If you're interested, the National Institute of Standards maintains a similar database of vulnerabilities called [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/).) [your goal here isn't to ___, it's to _____]

#### Key Topics

* What is an attack vector?
* What is a vulnerability database? Why might this be useful?
* What do you think the ideal vulnerability disclosure process would look like from the perspective of an ethical hacker? How about from the perspective of a company?
