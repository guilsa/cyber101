# Attack Vectors & Attack Surface

A common idea in the world of cybersecurity is that of an 'attack vector.' Put simply, an attack vector is a potential vulnerability that can be exploited in order to, for example, gain unauthorized access to a system. An attack vector against a home might be an unsecured lock. An attack vector against a website might be an admin account with an insecure password. Against a large corporation, an attack vector might be employee's email accounts — after all, a cybercriminal could likely fool at least one employee into revealing their login credentials using a phishing email.

?> **This is important!** You'll need to fully understand the concept of attack vectors to understand the materials that will follow later in the course.

The following readings are a collection of stories and technical documents that will give you a sense of what attack vectors are in the real world.
