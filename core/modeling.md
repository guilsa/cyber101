# Threat Modeling

There is no such thing as a perfectly secure system, and there's no reason for you to try to create one. Instead, your job as a security expert is to minimize a system's risk of intrusion while still maintaining some degree of usefulness — in other words, maintain _opsec_ (operational security). You won't be able to patch every hole in a system, so instead you should prioritize those which fit each system's particular situation. There's no need for the average small business to invest in military-like security practices; similarly, it would be negligent for a military to employ security practices more akin to those of a small business.

This is called _threat modeling_. As in previous sections, [Wikipedia's explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) will be used as the working definition:

> Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized – all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. (Wikipedia, "Threat model")

As you might expect, threat modeling is not unique to computer security. Most people perform some form of threat modeling every day: for example, we tend to secure our front doors more than any other door in the house. They may all be doors, however an insecure front door is an attack vector that carries greater risk than, say, an unlocked cabinet door.

Put simply: understand each system's particular vulnerabilities, and pick your battles wisely.

?> **This is a dense topic.** It is recommended that you take multiple days to work through and internalize these materials.

This longform-style article by Ryan Gallagher explores his own process of threat modeling (and is strongly inspired by the previous two materials). In addition to summarizing common vulnerabilities and threat actors, the article also provides a substantial survey of common ideas and terms in cybersecurity that you'll want to be sure you understand.
