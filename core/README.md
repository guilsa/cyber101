Before diving in to topics like cryptography and networking, it's important to make sure that you're confident in the basics of cybersecurity. That means understanding the difference between 'white hat' and 'black hat' hacking, the potential legal ramifications for cybercrime, and concepts such as 'attack vectors' and 'threat modeling' â€” just to give a few examples.

The purpose of this first unit is to bring you up to speed on the language and concepts employed by security professionals. Without this background knowledge, you may find it difficult to understand the readings included later in these materials.

### Unit Questions

By the end of this unit, you should be able to confidently answer the following questions:

* What is cybersecurity? What is hacking? What is the difference?
* What behavior is 'white hat' hacking? What kind of behavior is 'black hat' hacking? Where is the line?
* What are the potential legal ramifications for hackers? How have these laws been applied in the past?
* What is an attack vector? What is an attack surface?
* What is threat modeling? What is a threat actor? Why is this so critical?
